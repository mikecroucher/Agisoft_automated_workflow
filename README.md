For the test case given to me by Bryony, the Densepointcloud build step took the longest amount of time.
On my mac, using the windows partition, that step reported the following performance characteristics for around 49 photos

```
Device 1: 100% work done with performance: 27.1 million samples/sec (CPU), device used for 1559.03 seconds
```

On Sharc, I used 118 photos and got the following performance characteristics

```
Device 1: 100% work done with performance: 34.3424 million samples/sec (CPU), device used for 3392.16 seconds
```

Why different number of photos on the two machines? Because I messed up.
